# The courswork 3 spawner package
Sets up the third and final coursework in Gazebo, including all models and tasks.

This package should be added to the comp0129_s22_robot repo on your machine as a submodule.

```bash
> cd ~/comp0129_s22_robot/src
> git submodule add https://github.com/COMP0129-S22/cw3_world_spawner.git
```

If you want to remove it later, you can do:

```bash
> cd ~/comp0129_s22_robot
> git submodule deinit --force src/cw3_world_spawner
> git rm --force src/cw3_world_spawner
```
